Simplified Explanation of the Brief
The Physio Activity platform will provide personalized physiotherapy recommendations based on data from smart wearables (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) to help employees stay healthy. It will be available as an employee benefit, like a gym membership perk that companies offer to their workers.

The platform will have three main types of users:

Employers (HR departments of companies)
Individuals (employees who use the platform to get exercise recommendations)
Physiotherapists (professionals who upload exercise routines and give recommendations)
Your task is to build a basic version of this platform, which includes portals (interfaces) for these three groups.

Key Components of the Project
Employers (HR Departments):

Role: HR departments will help their employees access the platform as a company benefit.
Responsibility: They are only facilitators; they don't have legal responsibility if something goes wrong.
Example: Just like the Cycle2Work scheme, where companies help employees buy bikes as part of a benefit program, but the company isn't responsible for the employee's bike usage.
Individuals (Employees):

Role: Employees will use the platform to get personalized exercise recommendations to help them stay healthy (especially for issues like back pain, knee pain, etc.).
What they'll do: They will agree to the platform’s terms and conditions (T&Cs), enter basic health information, and use the suggested exercises.
Example: Like BetterHelp, an online counseling platform. Users can sign up for therapy but understand that the therapists aren't responsible for their mental health outcomes. Similarly, individuals here must understand that physiotherapists aren't fully liable for their health.
Physiotherapists:

Role: Physiotherapists will use the platform to upload exercise routines and give recommendations.
Control over content: They can decide whether to share their exercises publicly (e.g., for generic issues like stretching routines) or privately (e.g., for specific clients with medical conditions).
Example: This is similar to YouTube or Physitrack:
YouTube: Creators can upload public videos for anyone to view.
Physitrack: Physiotherapists can create libraries of exercises and prescribe them to clients.
Step-by-Step Breakdown
Let’s go through each part step by step, explaining what you need to do and how it works.

1. Employers (HR departments)
What they need: A simple portal where HR staff can register employees and grant them access to the platform. For example, they might give out vouchers or access codes.
Their responsibility: HR just helps employees access the platform and isn't responsible for employees’ health or exercise progress.
What you need to build: A basic interface where an HR staff member can log in, view employees who are registered, and give them access to the platform.
2. Individuals (Employees)
What they need: A personalized experience where they can input health information (e.g., "I have back pain" or "I want to improve flexibility") and receive recommendations for exercises.
How it works: Instead of seeing a doctor or physiotherapist in person, they’ll use the platform to get basic exercise programs.
Important: They must agree to the platform's Terms and Conditions (T&Cs), which tell them this isn’t a replacement for a real doctor’s advice.
What you need to build:
A simple form where they input their health details.
A recommendation system that gives them exercises based on their inputs (this can be static for now, meaning you give a general set of exercises based on common problems like back pain).
3. Physiotherapists
What they need: A portal where they can create and upload exercise routines, either:
Public (anyone can view and use them) or,
Private (only certain clients can access them).
Example:
YouTube: Physiotherapists can upload general exercise videos that anyone can watch.
Physitrack: Physiotherapists can create detailed exercise programs and share them privately with specific clients.
What you need to build:
A basic interface where physiotherapists can log in and upload exercise videos or routines (this could be text-based for now).
Options to mark routines as public or private.
Explaining the Example Websites
Cycle2Work (https://www.cycle2work.info/)

What it is: A UK government scheme where employers help employees buy bikes through salary sacrifice.
How it works: The company doesn’t own the bike, but it facilitates the process by helping employees get tax benefits and finance the bike.
Relevance to your project: In your project, employers are facilitators; they help employees access the platform but aren't responsible for the outcomes.
BetterHelp (https://www.betterhelp.com/)

What it is: An online therapy platform where people can connect with licensed therapists.
How it works: Individuals sign up, and based on their needs, they’re matched with therapists. Users have to agree to T&Cs, understanding that this is just guidance and the platform/therapist isn’t liable for the outcomes.
Relevance to your project: Similar to BetterHelp, the PhysioActivity platform provides guidance (exercise recommendations), but it’s not a substitute for actual medical care. Users need to agree to T&Cs and understand this distinction.
YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/)

What it is: A video-sharing platform where users can upload videos and choose whether to make them public or private.
How it works: Creators upload content, and viewers can watch it. Some content is for everyone, while some can be private or restricted.
Relevance to your project: Physiotherapists will be like YouTube creators. They can upload exercises and decide whether these should be public (anyone can see) or private (for specific clients).
Physitrack (https://www.physitrack.com/en-gb)

What it is: A platform that helps physiotherapists create exercise programs and send them to their clients. Clients follow the programs at home.
How it works: Physios create libraries of exercises, choose routines for specific clients, and monitor their progress.
Relevance to your project: This is directly related to what you’re building. Your platform will allow physiotherapists to upload exercise routines for clients, just like Physitrack.
